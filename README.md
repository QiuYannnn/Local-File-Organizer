## Updates 🚀

**[2024/09] v0.0.2**:
* Featured by [Nexa Gallery](https://nexaai.com/gallery) and [Nexa SDK Cookbook](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk/tree/main/examples)!
* Dry Run Mode: check sorting results before committing changes
* Silent Mode: save all logs to a txt file for quieter operation
* Added file support:  `.md`, .`excel`, `.ppt`, and `.csv`
* Three sorting options: by content, by date, and by type
* The default text model is now [Llama3.2 3B](https://nexaai.com/meta/Llama3.2-3B-Instruct/gguf-q3_K_M/file)
* Improved CLI interaction experience
* Added real-time progress bar for file analysis

Please update the project by deleting the original project folder and reinstalling the requirements. Refer to the installation guide from Step 4.


## Roadmap 📅

- [x] Dockerfile for easier installation
- [ ] Copilot Mode: chat with AI to tell AI how you want to sort the file (ie. read and rename all the PDFs)
- [ ] Change models with CLI
- [ ] ebook format support
- [ ] audio file support
- [ ] video file support
- [ ] Implement best practices like Johnny Decimal
- [ ] Check file duplication
- [ ] People from [Nexa](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk) is helping me to make executables for macOS, Linux and Windows

## What It Does 🔍

This intelligent file organizer harnesses the power of advanced AI models, including language models (LMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), to automate the process of organizing files by:


* Scanning a specified input directory for files.
* Content Understanding:
  - **Textual Analysis**: Uses the [Llama3.2 3B](https://nexaai.com/meta/Llama3.2-3B-Instruct/gguf-q3_K_M/file) to analyze and summarize text-based content, generating relevant descriptions and filenames.
  - **Visual Content Analysis**: Uses the [LLaVA-v1.6](https://nexaai.com/liuhaotian/llava-v1.6-vicuna-7b/gguf-q4_0/file) , based on Vicuna-7B, to interpret visual files such as images, providing context-aware categorization and descriptions.

* Understanding the content of your files (text, images, and more) to generate relevant descriptions, folder names, and filenames.
* Organizing the files into a new directory structure based on the generated metadata.

The best part? All AI processing happens 100% on your local device using the [Nexa SDK](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk). No internet connection required, no data leaves your computer, and no AI API is needed - keeping your files completely private and secure.

- **Conda:** Anaconda or Miniconda installed.
- **Git:** For cloning the repository (or you can download the code as a ZIP file).

## Installation 🛠

> For SDK installation and model-related issues, please post on [here](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk/issues).

### 1. Install Python

Before installing the Local File Organizer, make sure you have Python installed on your system. We recommend using Python 3.12 or later.

You can download Python from [the official website]((https://www.python.org/downloads/)).

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/QiuYannnn/Local-File-Organizer.git
```

Or download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your desired location.

### 3. Set Up the Python Environment

Create a new Conda environment named `local_file_organizer` with Python 3.12:

```zsh
conda create --name local_file_organizer python=3.12
```

Activate the environment:

```zsh
conda activate local_file_organizer
```

### 4. Install Nexa SDK ️

#### CPU Installation
To install the CPU version of Nexa SDK, run:
```bash
pip install nexaai --prefer-binary --index-url https://nexaai.github.io/nexa-sdk/whl/cpu --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple --no-cache-dir
```

#### GPU Installation (Metal - macOS)
For the GPU version supporting Metal (macOS), run:
```bash
CMAKE_ARGS="-DGGML_METAL=ON -DSD_METAL=ON" pip install nexaai --prefer-binary --index-url https://nexaai.github.io/nexa-sdk/whl/metal --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple --no-cache-dir
```
For detailed installation instructions of Nexa SDK for **CUDA** and **AMD GPU** support, please refer to the [Installation section](https://github.com/NexaAI/nexa-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) in the main README.


### 5. Install Dependencies

1. Ensure you are in the project directory:
   ```zsh
   cd path/to/Local-File-Organizer
   ```
   Replace `path/to/Local-File-Organizer` with the actual path where you cloned or extracted the project.

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```zsh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Note:** If you encounter issues with any packages, install them individually:

```zsh
pip install nexa Pillow pytesseract PyMuPDF python-docx
```

With the environment activated and dependencies installed, run the script using:

### 6. Running the Script🎉
```zsh
python main.py
```

# Docker Installation 🐳

You can easily set up the project in a containerized environment using the provided `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`. This allows you to avoid manual dependencies and complicated setups, while keeping everything isolated in Docker containers.

## Steps to Install and Run the Project in Docker

Follow the instructions below to get started.

---

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository and navigate into the project's directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QiuYannnn/Local-File-Organizer.git
cd Local-File-Organizer
```

### 2. Build the Docker Image

Use the following command to build the Docker image and start the container. The `docker-compose` file automatically handles the build process:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This step will:

- Automatically download, install, and configure all required dependencies.
- Take care of CUDA runtime libraries, Nvidia drivers, `nvidia-smi`, and other GPU-related setups if necessary.

You don't need to install any of these dependencies manually—Docker will handle everything during the image build process.

> 💡 **Note:** Optionally, to avoid re-downloading pre-trained models, you can mount your local `.cache` directory to the Docker container’s `.cache` directory. This will save time if you already have certain models downloaded:
>
> Example of how to mount the folder:
>
> ```yaml
> volumes:
>   - /path/to/your/.cache:/root/.cache
> ```

### That's it! 🎉

You’re now ready to  run and develop the project inside a fully containerized environment. No worries about manually installing dependencies or compatibility issues across systems.

## Notes

- **SDK Models:**
  - The script uses `NexaVLMInference` and `NexaTextInference` models [usage](https://docs.nexaai.com/sdk/python-interface/gguf).
  - Ensure you have access to these models and they are correctly set up.
  - You may need to download model files or configure paths.


- **Dependencies:**
  - **pytesseract:** Requires Tesseract OCR installed on your system.
    - **macOS:** `brew install tesseract`
    - **Ubuntu/Linux:** `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr`
    - **Windows:** Download from [Tesseract OCR Windows Installer](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
  - **PyMuPDF (fitz):** Used for reading PDFs.

- **Processing Time:**
  - Processing may take time depending on the number and size of files.
  - The script uses multiprocessing to improve performance.

- **Customizing Prompts:**
  - You can adjust prompts in `data_processing.py` to change how metadata is generated.
